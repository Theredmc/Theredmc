- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Theredmc
LetÂ´s say I am a weird Person but always try out new stuff, I even tried changing the Parallels Desktop 14 Hypervisor.

NEWS:

-I hope adguard is giving me a beta license key since my 14 day trial ran out otherwise I cant test the m1 version + without a stable release version for the m1 mac
I wouldnt spent money on it.
Do I do this to get free adguard? Quick answer yes but does not everyone do this otherwise they would just buy the full version but I hope that I can still submit crash reports

-Math test on 12.05.2021
yes a math test how fun, I hope the infections rise again so it falling flat.
I am really not good at math. 

-Today is the 7.05 and Adguard still didnt send any email sad right?
But I Emailed the makers of sensei maybe they are a bit nicer
